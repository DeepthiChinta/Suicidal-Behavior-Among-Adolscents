# Suicidal-Behavior-Among-Adolscents 

# Introduction
This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze and predict the rate of suicidal behavior among adolescents based on various contributing factors. By employing a dataset that includes attributes such as overweight status, sex, age group, current alcohol consumption, parental understanding, history of fights, experiences of bullying, and the presence of close friends, this ML model aims to provide insights into the complex relationship between these factors and adolescent suicide rates.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is carefully curated to include relevant information on adolescents, emphasizing attributes that are known to influence mental health. Each entry in the dataset represents an individual, and the associated attributes are used to train the ML model.

# Predictive Attributes
The following attributes are considered in the model for predicting suicidal behavior among adolescents:


- **Sex:** Analyzing any gender-related patterns in suicidal behavior among adolescents.

- **Age Group:** Understanding how different age groups may exhibit varying rates of suicidal behavior.

- **Overweight Status:** Identifying the potential correlation between overweight adolescents and an increased risk of suicidal tendencies.

- **Alcohol Consumption:** Exploring the impact of current alcohol consumption on the likelihood of suicidal tendencies.

- **Parental Understanding:** Investigating the role of understanding and supportive parents in mitigating the risk of suicidal behavior.

- **History of Fights:** Assessing the correlation between a history of physical altercations and suicidal tendencies.

- **Bullying Experience:** Examining the influence of bullying experiences on the likelihood of suicidal behavior.

- **Presence of Close Friends:** Understanding the role of social connections in reducing the risk of adolescent suicide.
